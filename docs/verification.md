# Native skeleton verification

Verified 2026-10-05 against [plan section 1](plan.md#1-repository-skeleton). All five scoped criteria passed; the independent reviewer reported no actionable findings. This is acceptance of the disconnected skeleton, not the remote attachment spike.

## Independent review

Fresh local Herdr peer `cappuccino-verifier`, task-created pane `w1:p5N`, used `openai-codex/gpt-6-luna`. The owner explicitly selected this alternative after Anthropic readiness returned `not_ready`. Startup argv specified `--thinking medium`; the visible runtime footer also showed medium. `PI_EFFORT` was empty, so the effort evidence is the argv/footer, not that environment variable. The substantive report established model usability; startup readiness alone did not.

The peer received read/search/gate authority only, without the implementation conversation. It confirmed the staged fingerprints and reported no unexpected source/index changes:

| Owning Git | Branch and base commit | Reviewed staged binary diff SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cappuccino | `feat/native-skeleton`, `84aba5575459208e2e8eacec79c90e9af94f1850` | `46c9c9391a4e940370e13b962f6b15d2537e8a6feb9270bdb15d34d06434cddf` |
| Workstation | `main`, `bcb9569874d7f57171afb6725ae66673904adca3` | `c0e8a23ca59b96fdec4ddab84a0376a8d48774beac4485698e6efdcbe5e05627` |

These identify the reviewed working diffs before this evidence record was added. The record changes no Swift, test, build configuration or acceptance contract inputs.

## Performed checks

All commands below were independently performed with exit 0; no earlier lead gate was reused in their place. Xcode/Swift commands used the per-command `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` override, leaving machine-global developer selection unchanged.

| Command | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Native `make validate` | Swift style, Markdown, 3 hermetic core tests, generated project, iOS Simulator app build and shared macOS shell build passed. |
| Native `make ui-test DESTINATION="platform=iOS Simulator,id=131B54FD-065E-4611-BCEA-7716C632768B"` | 1 XCTest, 0 failures: Chats disconnected state, disabled Send, Nudge/Follow-up controls, Attention and Machines empty states; three screenshot attachments. |
| Workstation `make validate` | Root check (79 tests), generated-catalog freshness, status, live Asobi read and documentation build passed. |
| Workstation `make build-docs` | Documentation build passed. |

Environment: Xcode 27.0, Swift 6.4, task-owned iPhone 18 Pro Simulator with iOS 27.0. Independent XCTest result: `.build/xcode/Logs/Test/Test-Cappuccino-2026.10.05_18-05-28-+0900.xcresult` in Cappuccino. Build/test bundles are ignored local evidence, not portable release artifacts.

## Criterion results

1. **Met:** dependency-free SwiftPM core and minimal shared SwiftUI shell replace Java/Gradle; Git history and GPL-3.0 unchanged; no fabricated connection or speculative bridge.
2. **Met:** honest Chats/Attention/Machines states, unavailable sending, explicit delivery choices and machine-scoped identity tests; the disconnected iPhone journey executed successfully.
3. **Met:** Make/mise, pinned non-Xcode tools, two-space style, pure-core separation, declarative Xcode generation, generated-output exclusions and truthful docs/CI.
4. **Met within scope:** structural/core/build gates and the actual iPhone Simulator shell journey pass. Mac acceptance is build-only.
5. **Met:** workstation catalog integration is fresh and consistent; the optional vphone source assessment records its revision, host-policy/storage risks, installation caveats and separate approval boundary.

## Limits and warnings

Xcode emitted the no-AppIntents-dependency metadata warning. The iOS beta runtime emitted duplicate Accessibility-class and debugger-lookup diagnostics. No checks were suppressed; builds and tests passed.

Not tested or implemented: authenticated remote bridge, existing-agent/session/active-branch continuity, real prompts or approvals, grants/reconnect behavior, Telegram/APNs/background delivery, physical-iPhone signing/provisioning, minimum-OS coverage, live Mac UI or vphone guest execution. The next bounded work is [the disposable-session attachment spike](plan.md#2-disposable-session-attachment-spike); no deployment or host-security change is authorized by this verification.
